### Core Modules

**Scheduling Module:** Manages appointments, calendar availability, and conflict detection
**Medical Records Module:** Handles patient medical history, treatments, and documentation
**Owners/Pets Module:** Manages pet registration, owner information, and relationships
**Lookups Module:** Provides reference data for species, breeds, and medical codes

### Scalability Path

The modular design enables extraction of specific modules into microservices as scale demands increase. Priority extraction order: background workers (notifications, jobs), then API modules per bounded context.

```

## API Documentation

The API follows REST principles with consistent resource naming and standard HTTP methods. All endpoints are versioned under `/api/v1`.

### Authentication

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token-here
```

### Key Endpoints

**Authentication:**
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` - Token refresh
- `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` - User logout

**Pets Management:**
- `GET /api/v1/pets` - List all pets (with pagination and filtering)
- `POST /api/v1/pets` - Create new pet
- `GET /api/v1/pets/{id}` - Get pet details
- `PUT /api/v1/pets/{id}` - Update pet information
- `DELETE /api/v1/pets/{id}` - Remove pet record

**Appointments:**
- `GET /api/v1/appointments` - List appointments
- `POST /api/v1/appointments` - Schedule new appointment
- `PUT /api/v1/appointments/{id}` - Update appointment
- `DELETE /api/v1/appointments/{id}` - Cancel appointment

**Medical Records:**
- `GET /api/v1/pets/{pet_id}/medical-records` - Get pet's medical history
- `POST /api/v1/pets/{pet_id}/medical-records` - Create new medical record
- `PUT /api/v1/medical-records/{id}` - Update medical record
- `GET /api/v1/medical-records/{id}/treatments` - Get treatments for record

### Interactive API Documentation

Visit http://localhost:8000/docs for interactive API documentation powered by FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI generation.

## Database Schema

The database schema is designed for optimal performance and data integrity with the following key entities:

### Core Entities

**Owners:** Store client information including contact details and addresses
**Pets:** Pet information linked to owners with species, breed, and medical identifiers
**Species & Breeds:** Reference tables for animal classification
**Users:** System users with role-based access control
**Appointments:** Scheduling data with conflict prevention constraints
**Medical Records:** Visit records with comprehensive medical information
**Treatments:** Detailed treatment and medication records
**Audit Log:** Complete audit trail for compliance and security

### Key Relationships

- Owners have multiple Pets (one-to-many)
- Pets have multiple Medical Records (one-to-many)
- Medical Records have multiple Treatments (one-to-many)
- Appointments link Pets with Veterinarian Users
- All modifications are tracked in the Audit Log

### Performance Optimizations

Strategic indexing on frequently queried fields including pet names, owner information, appointment dates, and veterinarian assignments ensures sub-200ms response times for all operations.

## User Roles & Permissions

The system implements role-based access control with four primary user types:

### Veterinarian
**Full Access:** Complete access to all pet medical records, treatment plans, and appointment scheduling
**Key Capabilities:** Create and modify medical records, prescribe treatments, access all patient histories

### Veterinary Technician  
**Limited Clinical Access:** Can update patient records and assist with medical data entry
**Key Capabilities:** Update appointment status, add basic medical information, assist with patient intake

### Receptionist
**Administrative Focus:** Manages appointments, client information, and basic pet registration
**Key Capabilities:** Schedule appointments, manage client database, handle check-in/check-out processes

### Pet Owner
**Personal Data Only:** Can view their own pets' information and basic medical summaries
**Key Capabilities:** View pet information, access vaccination records, see upcoming appointments

CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-domain.com
```

**Security Considerations:**
- Use environment-specific secrets management
- Enable SSL/TLS for all communications  
- Configure proper CORS origins
- Set up database connection pooling
- Enable comprehensive audit logging

### CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions workflow handles:
- Code quality checks (linting, formatting)
- Comprehensive test suite execution
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Docker image building and registry push
- Automated deployment to staging environments

## Performance & Monitoring

- **Database Query Time:** < 50ms for standard operations
- **Frontend Load Time:** < 3 seconds for initial page load
- **Concurrent Users:** Support for 100+ simultaneous users

### Monitoring Strategy
**Application Metrics:** Request latency, error rates, throughput per endpoint
**Business Metrics:** Appointments scheduled, medical records created, user activity
**Infrastructure Metrics:** Database performance, memory usage, CPU utilization

**Observability Tools:**
- Structured logging with request correlation IDs
- Health check endpoints for service monitoring
- Database query performance tracking
- Frontend error boundary reporting

## Security

### Security Measures

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- JWT-based authentication with configurable expiration
- Role-based access control with principle of least privilege
- Secure password hashing using industry-standard algorithms

**Data Protection:**
- Input validation on all API endpoints using Pydantic schemas
- SQL injection prevention through ORM parameter binding
- XSS protection through output sanitization
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations

**Infrastructure Security:**
- HTTPS enforcement in production environments
- Database connection encryption
- Environment variable protection for sensitive configuration
- Regular security dependency updates

**Compliance:**
- Comprehensive audit logging for all data modifications
- Data retention policies for medical records
- User access logging and monitoring
- HIPAA-compliant data handling procedures

### Security Best Practices

All developers should follow secure coding practices including input validation, output encoding, error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information, and regular security testing as part of the development workflow.
